Java Packages
-java.util - contains utility packages
-java.applet - the gui package
-java.io - contains input output packages

Creating Custom packages
-Create package in src
-create new class in that package

Exeption Handling
2 types
1) Checked exception (CompileTime)
3) Unchecked exception (RunTime) eg - typecast error, null ptr exceptions
	
	Object
	  |
      Throwable
	 / \
    Error   Exception
(unchecked)    / \
        Runtime   Compiletime
    (unchecked)      (checked)
   
Check Exceptions
-IO Exception
-SQL Exception
-ClassNotFoundException

Unchecked Exceptions
-Arithmetic Exceptions
-Null Pointer Exceptions
-IndexOutofBounds Exceptions
	-ArrayIndexOutOfBound Exceptions
	-StringIndexOutOfBound Exceptions
-InputMismatchException

Errors
-Stack Overflow Errors
-Virtual Machine Errors

Imp Keywords
-try - specify a block where we should place and exception code
-catch - this block catches error of try block
-finally - execute the necessary code of the program, it is always executed even if the exception is handled or not
-throw - The throw keyword in Java is used to explicitly throw an exception from a method or any block of code. When we want to create our own exception
	- We can create an exception which extends exception class and use a function to throw that error 


multiple catch blocks can be defined below a try block when u dont know which type of exception might come, directly u can use Exception e

Strings
#String Pool
-String Literal vs String Object
-Object creating using String buffer are useful when u have to store data in memory
-If there is a string which is going to change its value frequently then u should use string buffer
-Whenever u create an object using String Buffer it gets stored in string pool and doesnt allow any duplicated, it gets stored in java heap.


Methods of Java Strings(Pretty much self explainatory) 
(Methods might have different name for String buffer and String literal)

String buffer is slower than String builder because of Thread Lock time(Thread Safety)

Collections - Extendend Cut

Hash Tables
	-It does not allow duplicate tables
	-When u require faster searches, use hashtables

Hash Set
	-Hash set stores elements by using mechanism called hashing
	-it contains unique elements only
	-allows null values
	-class is non synchronized
	-doesn't maintain the insertion order. Here, elements are inserted on the basis of their hashcode
	-it is the best approach for search operations
	
Hash Map
	-Contains values based on key
	-Contains only unique keys
	-may have one null keys
